A simple chat app built with Swift UI using Firebase as backend.

Built while coding along the [tutorial from "Let's build the App" on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2gCYXonUXM&list=PL0dzCUj1L5JEN2aWYFCpqfTBeVHcGZjGw&index=1). So credits for him.

To run locally you need to setup Firebase with Auth, Storage and Firestore and download the GoogleService-Info.plist into /realtimechat.
