## Mobile Native Development Learning

I've been using React Native to develop mobile apps and I love it. But I think it's time to also learn the native technologies.

This repo contains projects I'm working on in order to learn iOS and Android native development.

### 1 - realtimechat-ios [In progress]

A simple chat app built with Swift UI using Firebase as backend.

Built while coding along the [tutorial from "Let's build the App" on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2gCYXonUXM&list=PL0dzCUj1L5JEN2aWYFCpqfTBeVHcGZjGw&index=1). So credits for him.
